# Find unique pairs that sum to target value

This is not an actual leetcode problem, just a similar example.

Given an integer array A, sorted in ascending order, find all pairs of integers that
sum to a target value.

We will solve this using two different approaches:
- Nested for loop. This has O(n^2) runtime
- Two-pointer approach. This has O(n) runtime
